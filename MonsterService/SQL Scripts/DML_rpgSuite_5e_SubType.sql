insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (1,'Aarakocra','Feathers cover their bodies. Their plumage typically denotes membership in a tribe. Males are brightly colored, with feathers of red, orange, or yellow. Females have more subdued colors, usually brown or gray.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (2,'Any Race','');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (3,'Bullywug','Life as a bullywug is nasty, brutish, and wet. These frog-headed amphibious humanoids must stay constantly moist, dwelling in rainy forests, marshes, and damp caves. Always hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when they can, but they flee from serious threats to search for easier prey.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (4,'Derro','Derro The derro are degenerate Underdark humanoids that resemble small dwarves. Cruel and insane, they take delight in tormenting others — even their own kind. Derro have blue-gray skin and straight hair that is white or yellow in color. Their uniformly pale white eyes lack both irises and pupils.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (5,'Dragonborn','Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension.

insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (6,'Dwarf','Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (7,'Elf','Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (8,'Firenewt','Elemental fire in its worst incarnation. Heat Seekers. Firenewts need hot water to live and breed. A firenewt becomes sluggish, mentally and physically, after spending a week away from an external
source of moist heat. A prolonged lack of heat can shut down a firenewt community, as the creatures within go into hibernation and their eggs stop developing. ');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (9,'Gith',' Inspired by the great leader for whom the race is named, the gith rose up to overthrow the mind flayers that held them in servitude. But after they won their freedom, two factions among the gith disagreed on what kind of civilization they would forge. That disagreement quickly flared into open hostility, and the two groups distanced themselves from one another to pursue their separate agendas.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (10,'Gnoll','Gnolls are feral humanoids that attack settlements along the frontiers and borderlands of civilization without warning, slaughtering their victims and devouring their flesh.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (11,'Goblinoid','Goblinoids have a typical humanoid anatomy, though the skin tone and texture is often somewhere between that of a human and that of a snail, with the notable exception of the bugbear, which is covered head to toe in thick fur. Heights vary greatly among different species of goblinoids, ranging from 3 to 7 feet (0.9 to 2.1m). Goblinoid build is usually thick and muscular, and they possess faces that have similar attributes. Their appearance can often be repulsive.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (12,'Grimlock','The degenerate subterranean grimlocks were once human, but their worship of the mind flayers over generations of prowling the Underdark transformed them into blind, monstrous cannibals long ago.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (13,'Grung','Grungs are aggressive froglike humanoids found in rain forests and tropical jungles. They are fiercely territorial and see themselves as superior to most other creatures.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (14,'Half-dragon','When a dragon in polymorphed form mates with another creature, the union sometimes produces half-dragon offspring. A creature might also transform into a half-dragon as a result of a mad wizard’s spell or a ritual bath in dragon’s blood. In all these cases, the result is a creature that combines the essence of a dragon with the form of its original race. Regardless of their origins, all half-dragons have similar features and appearance, gaining special senses, resistance to destructive energy, and a breath weapon.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (15,'Half-elf','Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (16,'Halfling','The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road or a raft floating downriver');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (17,'Half-orc','Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (18,'Human','In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (19,'Kenku','Kenku are feathered humanoids that wander the world as vagabonds, driven by greed. They can perfectly imitate any sound they hear.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (20,'Kobold','Kobolds are craven reptilian humanoids that commonly infest dungeons. They make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (21,'Kraul','The kraul are an ascendant power group within the Golgari Swarm, long content to linger at the margins of the undercity but now increasingly making their buzzing voices heard.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (22,'Kuo-toa','Kuo-toa are degenerate fishlike humanoids that once inhabited the shores and islands of the surface world.

insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (23,'Lizardfolk','Lizardfolk are primitive reptilian humanoids that lurk in swamps and jungles. Fiercely territorial, they kill when it is expedient and do whatever it takes to survive.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (24,'Locathah',' These resilient and proud fish-folk (found in Danger at Dunwater) have endured war, slavery, and mistreatment at the hands of other aquatic creatures. They dwell in submerged tribal villages.');

insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (26,'Merfolk','Merfolk are aquatic humanoids with the lower body of a fish. They live in small tribes beneath the waves.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (27,'Nagpa','Long ago, the Raven Queen cursed a cabal of thirteen powerful wizards for meddling in a ritual that would have helped avert a war between the gods. She stripped them of their beauty, turning them into scabrous, birdlike monstrosities. The nagpas now plot as they ever did, but they now strive to bring about terrible, world-shaking calamities so they can pry secrets and power from the wreckage their conspiracies create.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (28,'Orc','Orcs are savage humanoids with stooped postures, piggish faces, and prominent teeth that resemble tusks. They gather in tribes that satisfy their bloodlust by slaying any humanoids that stand against them.');

insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (30,'Simic Hybrid','Simic Combine has extended this research to humanoid subjects situations. These hyper-evolved specimens are called Simic hybrids, though they sometimes refer to themselves as guardians.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (31,'Sahuagin','Across fog-shrouded coasts or endless ocean swells, an ominous drone sounded on a conch shell chills the blood of all who hear it. This is the sound of the sahuagin hunting horn — a call to raid and battle. Coastal settlers refer to sahuagin as “sea devils,” for sahuagin have no compassion in them, slaughtering the crews of ships and decimating coastal villages.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (32,'Saurial','');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (33,'Tiefling','To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus — overlord of the Nine Hells — into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held accountable.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (34,'Tortle','What many tortles consider a simple life, others might call a life of adventure. Tortles are born near sandy coastlines, but as soon as they’re able to walk on two legs, they become nomad survivalists eager to explore the wilderness, experience its many wonders, put their skills to the test, and make new acquaintances.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (35,'Triton','Tritons guard the ocean depths, building small settlements beside deep trenches, portals to the elemental planes, and other dangerous spots far from the eyes of land-bound folk. Long-established guardians of the deep ocean floor, in recent years the noble tritons have become increasingly active in the world above.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (36,'Yuan-ti','Yuan-ti are devious serpent folk devoid of compassion. From remote temples in jungles, swamps, and deserts, the yuan-ti plot to supplant and dominate all other races and to make themselves gods.');
insert into CREATURE_SUBTYPES (ID,TYPE,DESCRIPTION) values (37,'Xvart','Xvarts are cruel, cowardly humanoids spawned by a cowardly, renegade demigod. They have blue skin, vivid orange eyes, and receding hairlines, mirroring their creator’s appearance. They stand about 3 feet tall.');
